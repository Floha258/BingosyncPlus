+ Select the folder you just unzipped
+ You are done.

On Chrome you'll get warnings about Developer Mode being turned on **every time you launch your browser**, but I'm not paying $5 to upload a 80KB extension on the store.

## What does Bingosync+ do?
For now the main feature is around Invasion Lockout, the extension can display clickable goals and mistakes from either player. You can disable both types of indicators individually in the settings menu.
The indicators will only show up if two or more people are in the Bingosync room. Only the first 2 players' colors will be displayed.

More features may come in the future depending on tournaments and user feedback.
